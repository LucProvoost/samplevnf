SampleVNF_ is an OPNFV Project.

The project's goal was to provide a placeholder for various sample VNF
(Virtual Network Function (:term:`VNF`)) development which includes example
reference architecture and optimization methods related to VNF/Network service
for high performance VNFs.
Today, we only maintain PROX and rapid scripts as part of this project
to perform Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure
(:term:`NFVI`) characterization.

*SampleVNF* is used in OPNFV for characterization of NFVI on OPNFV infrastructure.
